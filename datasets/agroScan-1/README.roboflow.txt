The dataset includes 54 images.
Mango are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 51 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -26째 to +26째 horizontally and -25째 to +25째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -40 and +40 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 11 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
